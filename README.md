# PackUpdate
I decided to customize the shit out of [XDjackieXD's PackUpdate](https://github.com/XDjackieXD/PackUpdate/).

## Changes
 - Uses Gradle to build now because I'm way too use to Gradle lmao

## TODO
 - Headless update mode
 - clientmod and servermod
 - Make config file-based rather than zip based so people can have customized configs that don't get deleted (usually)
